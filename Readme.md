A programming kata is an exercise which helps a programmer hone his skills through practice and repetition.

# Kata: Fizz Buzz
For a given natural number greater than zero return: 

* “fizz” if the number is dividable by 3  
* “buzz” if the number is dividable by 5  
* “fizzbuzz” if the number is dividable by 15  
* the same number if no other requirement is fulfilled

# Kata: Mars Rover
Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.
  
Rules:
  
* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.
* Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
* Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
* Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
* Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
